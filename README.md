# So like, funny little site here. Hoping to expanded it out later.

Original site was designed and built to just be the first home of my website. At this point, I have decided to change it into a more structured sysetm. 

My goal is to build it out to be more user friendly and to host my portfolio of projects and anything I feel like putting up on it. 

The redesign of the website will not affect the server, but some funtionalities may break. If something does break, send me a DM on Discord (Python1211).
